          ﻿From the Desk of Alan Stirling, Founder
          of the True Feng Shui School of Excellence,
          Founder of The Feng Shui Institute:
        </h2>
        <p>
          ﻿All  you need to improve your life (and the lives of
          others) is potentially slipping through your fingers
          by not taking advantage of the energy already in your home or office.
        </p>
        <p>
          ﻿Your space is a mesocosm of the outside world in the same way that an atom
          , the smallest building block of matter, is a replica of our own solar system.
        </p>
        <p>﻿By changing one we change the other; that's where you, the microcosm comes in. After all, how many times have you felt better after redecorating your own home or living environment?</p>
        <p>
          ﻿Now by learning feng shui you can do this with purpose and read your environment to see the effect it is already having on your life. Furthermore, you can make subtle changes without
          decorating, to invite the things that you want to happen manifest in your life
        </p>

          ﻿The world is saturated with incorrect “Feng Shui” information...<br>
          ...and although well intentioned,
          using these false methods is not only
          ineffective… <br><br>

          ﻿Unfortunately, most feng shui is shrouded in mystery, superstition or
          unscrupulously used by  traders to sell trinkets and baubles to make their own dreams come true. Alternatively, good information is drip fed to maximise profits.
        </h4>
        <p>﻿As feng shui is shrouded in secrecy, anyone can say that it is feng shui, but that doesn’t make it right - and doesn’t mean you will get positive results.</p>
        <p>
          ﻿Also our program is the only one that explains how feng shui works in practical and natural
          scientific terms, so that it can be explained and understood by everyone.
        </p>
        <h4 class="textTitleMedium">﻿Below are a couple examples of wrong feng shui:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              ﻿Staff refused to work at The Governor's Palace in Hong Kong
              because of bad feng shui coming from the Bank of China.
              They called in a feng shui master who recommended the
              wrong cure and made their situation even worse. Arguing
              fighting and no work being done continued until a True Feng
              Shui professional correctly analysed the issue, changed the
              cure and solved the problem. Harmony, efficiency and morale
              was restored.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              ﻿Another example of wrong feng shui advice. - a client had
              been told by a so called feng shui master that in order to sell
              their home they had to undergo major structural work costing
              £25,000.00. However, after a true Feng Shui consultation
              minor changes (costing nothing) were made within the home
              which balanced the energy and the house sold shortly
              afterwards.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          ﻿The Chinese view feng shui as an extremely powerful way of perpetuating their families
          prosperity for future generations.  Consequently, True feng shui masters only traditionally taught just one of their children,  and it was shrouded in mystery to all others, even  their own family.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">﻿﻿However, these outsiders just saw feng shui being applied, but did not know  why or even how.</p>
        <p>
          ﻿They  tried to explain the effects using  superstition to sell trinkets, which rely on your faith, rather than reason or even common sense. Or they “drip feed” the little information they have over a long period of time, which indoctrinates you into believing that even the slightest
          improvement.. is a miracle!

        <h4 class="textTitleMedium">﻿I first came across the words<b>&nbsp;Feng Shui&nbsp;</b>in a completely unrelated
          fictitious novel, which I bought to take my mind off of the war zone
          environment occuring at a Middle East airport on my way back from a business trip to the Gulf.
        </h4>
        <p>
          ﻿Just seeing these two words sparked something within me and I began my quest to discover its secrets. Returning to the UK, I  enquired at several libraries where I was told that it was
          possibly connected to either Origami... or the Kama Sutra… Not even close!
        </p>
        <p>﻿In this same year of 1986 Black Hat feng Shui was beginning in the USA, which I tried myself for a while. Although, the results were not sustainable long term, I  had a fascinating glimpse into true Feng Shui.</p>
        <p>However, I instinctively knew this was just the tip of the iceberg, and felt there was so much more information missing, so decided to learn to read and even write Chinese, to discover these  hidden secrets.</p>
        <h4 class="textTitleMedium italic">﻿Although Alan studied with feng shui masters from east and west, his real training began during a fateful day that happened quite by accident…</h4>
        <p>﻿As fate had it, I helped a random stranger whose gratitude led to an introduction  to her father that happened to be a distinguished Master of True Feng Shui.</p>
        <p>﻿His name was Master Fu and my life would never be the same again.</p>
        <p>﻿Having shown virtue, Master Fu decided to teach me feng shui himself, over several years of full time study, on just how to unravel the centuries old secrets of True Feng Shui.</p>
        <p>﻿Despite his incredible success Master Fu was a very humble and unassuming man, who valued virtues such as discretion and humility above all.</p>
        <p>﻿Perhaps it was this new lease of life that helped him to decide to teach me, instead of a son he never had.</p>
        <h4 class="textTitleMedium italic">﻿He never taught feng shui to anyone else before or after, and sadly died in 2014. He is sorely missed.</h4>
        <p>﻿I am incredibly grateful to him for his unique teaching, and because of him I have been  able to train some of the best feng shui consultants in the business, as well as help many around the world get great results.</p>
        <h4 class="textTitleMedium textCenter">﻿Our  testimonials reaffirm this</h4>
        <p>﻿On graduating I started to practice professionally. My clients were so amazed that I could tell exactly what was happening in their lives by the way they had arranged there furniture, fixtures and fittings. Moreover, I could also tell them what to put there instead, to achieve their goals, and greatly improve their quality of life.</p>
        <p>﻿Working primarily on personal referrals, my clients banded together and persuaded me to teach them all about true Feng Shui, and so in 1997 the<b>&nbsp;Feng Shui School of Excellence&nbsp;</b>began. I taught them and every student since how to do this professionally, both in class and by distance learning.</p>
        <p>﻿Since then, I have trained and continue to train consultants in many countries around the world. In 2000 I  helped set the industry standards and code of ethics.</p>
        <p>﻿True feng shui has been kept a secret for millennia and used only amongst the elite and powerful to enrich their lives and attain success.</p>
        <p>﻿As we can all benefit from feng shui, it is good to know that according to the universal principles of yin and yang, life alternates from one extreme to another.</p>
        <p>﻿Master Fu and I shared the dream that one day children will be freely taught feng shui at school and that it could be used in hospital environments to aid healing and reduce stress.</p>
        <p>﻿When used in nature, it helps plants and animals to thrive which would assist us to feed the world. Finally, using feng shui in our homes creates a nurturing sanctuary that attracts all.</p>
        <p>﻿Now what a wonderful world that would be.</p>

          he mentioned that most of the measures we could take were based on
          common sense and in retrospect I can see he was right. After the visit
          there was a lot of interest from both clients and staff and I was

          achieve their goals. They usually can't keep the results quiet either, and tell their family and

          "On a whim, I signed up for the taster session about 48hrs before it
          started, not really knowing what I was letting myself in for. I had tried
          to read about Feng Shui in the past and found it unfathomable. As I
          soon discovered, Alan thankfully has a way of making what in the average
          person's hands is an incredibly complex, impenetrable subject into
          something logical, practical and easy to digest (and often times very
          funny too). By lunchtime on the 1st day I was already certain I wanted
          to take the full professional accreditation. The breadth and depth of
          what we covered over the course of the year is asspan.italic unding and I can't

          I came to this course simply to add another layer to my bow as an Interior
          Designer, yet after being exposed to the vase dynamics of FENG
          SHUI, I leave this course with the intention of making it my sole speciality.
          What I have learnt has profoundly changed not only the direction
          of my life, but also the very way in which I view it. The insight I
          have gained into myself and my environment, as well as those around
          me has been immeasurable. Knowing what I now know, I am just so
          excited to start the next part of my journey and take what I had learnt
          out into the world! Thank you Alan, Sachelle Class of 2017- UK
          The more I study Feng Shui the more I realise how little I know and
          how much there is to learn. It's disheartening to realise just how little I
          did learn from other schools, but I suppose I had to start somewhere.

          I think you have done an excellent job. In the philosophical part, you
          provide the information in an easy to understand pictorial manner that
          even I, with my limited knowledge of English, can understand the Chinese
          approach without getting lost in needless data. The practical part
          seems to be written in a way that makes the more difficult concepts
          easier to understand. I think I will have learned a lot about Feng Shui
          when I have finished this course.Herbert Rhein - Germany"

          “I just like to say a big "thank you " for being my Feng Shui Teacher for
          the past year. I have found your class informative, constructive, interesting
          and lots of fun. Each month we are presented with a different
          topic, some more challenging than others. Just as we think we have
          grasped the idea, you would add another layer on top making it more
          interesting and challenging. However, you are very patient and reassuring.
          You have a unique way of making things easy to understand.
          Then surely just like you said, as if you have waved a magic wand; like
          that part of a jigsaw puzzle, everything that we've learnt just falls into
